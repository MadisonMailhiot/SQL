--First I created the Spotifydata table in SQLiteStudio
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

--1. What are the top 5 most popular songs?
SELECT track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 5

--2. Who are the top 10 most popular artists? 
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) as Avg_popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY Avg_popularity DESC 
LIMIT 10

--3. We want to create a playlist to cool down to after exercise. Select only songs with a tempo between 60 and 95. 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE tempo > 60 AND tempo < 95

--4. What's the average valence of the 3 most popular songs? 
SELECT avg(valence)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >= '95'

--5. How many artists have more than one song included in the database?
SELECT artist_name, count(track_id)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING count(track_id) > 1

--6. What is the average danceability of the top 3 most popular songs? 
SELECT avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity = (
SELECT popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 3
);
