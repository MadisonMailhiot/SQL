--This file contains the SQL I used to query a fictional Superstore database. 

--1. First, I ordered the items by price
SELECT *
FROM superstore 
ORDER BY price
;

--2. Next, I calculated the average price of an item at Superstore

SELECT AVG(price)
FROM superstore
;

--3. Next, I calculated the average price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies"

SELECT AVG(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category = "Kitchen Supplies"
;

--4. Lastly, I wrote a query to determine which product has the lowest average rating at Superstore
SELECT item_name, average_rating
FROM superstore
ORDER BY average_rating 
LIMIT 1
;
