--In this file I have included the SQL queries I wrote in SQLite to answer the questions below about customer and order data from a database containing multiple tables.    

-- 1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

--2. How many of the orders placed in January were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone'

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct Product, MIN(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product, price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) as Number_Sold, SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT 
count(distinct cust.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN  BIT_DB.customers cust 
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

--8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold. 
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%' 
GROUP BY Product

--9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? 

SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location like '%NY%'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID) > 2

--10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT distinct Product, sum(quantity) as 'Number of Units Sold'
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product like '%Headphones%'
GROUP BY product 

--11. What was the average amount spent per account in February? 

SELECT sum(quantity*price)/count(c.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
ON Feb.orderID = c.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

--12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).

SELECT sum(quantity)/count(c.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
ON Feb.orderID = c.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

--13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total? 

SELECT product, sum(quantity*price) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product 
ORDER BY revenue DESC
